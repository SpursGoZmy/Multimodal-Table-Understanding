## 1.Introduction

Although great progress has been made by recent LLM-based table understanding methods, they rely heavily on the premise that given tables must be converted into a certain text sequence (such as Markdown or HTML) to serve as model input. However, it is difficult to access high-quality textual table representations in some real-world scenarios like scanned documents and webpage screentshots, and table images are much more accessible. Therefore, how to directly understand tables using intuitive visual information
is a crucial and urgent challenge for developing more practical applications.

Facing the above challenge, we propose the multimodal table understanding problem, where the model is required to generate correct responses to different table-related requests (e.g., questions) in an end-to-end fashion based on the table image. Correspondingly, we construct **MMTab**, the first open-source large-scale dataset for multimodal table understanding problem, which can support both the training and evaluation of generalist MLLMs towards multimodal table understanding. Based on the curated MMTab dataset, we develop a versatile tabular MLLM named **Table-LLaVA** with an enhanced two-stage training paradigm of LLaVA v1.5. Table-LLaVA beats
strong MLLM baselines on 17 held-in and 6 held-out benchmarks, and is even competitive with the powerful GPT-4V on 14 benchmarks under a subset of test samples. The right figure shows an intuitive comparison of Table LLaVA 7B and existing MLLMs on various multimodal table understanding benchmarks.

## 2. Dataset Description
We constructed MMTab based on 14 publicly available table datasets of 8 domains. We carefully design scripts to convert original textual tables in these datasets into table images highlighting a broad coverage of table structures and styles, and transform all task-specific samples into multimodal instruction-tuning samples with a unified format of ```<table image, input request,
output response>```. The resulting dataset contains three parts and can be downloaded from the [Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpursgoZmy/MMTab). During the dataset
construction, data augmentations at multiple levels (e.g., table-level, task-level) were adopted to further improve the data diversity.

| Dataset Split | #Table Images | #Samples |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **MMTab-pre** | 97K | 150K table recognition samples for pre-training |
| **MMTab-instruct** | 82K | 232K samples of 14 table-based tasks for instruction-tuning |
| **MMTab-eval** | 23K | 45K samples of 17 held-in benchmarks and 4K samples of 7 held-out benchmarks for evaluation |

Dataset examples are shown in the following figure and more examples are shown in the Appendix A in the original paper.

## 3. Model Weights
Table LLaVA follows the LLaVA v1.5 architecture, with [CLIP-ViT-L-336px](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336) as the visual encoder (336*336 image resolution), [Vicuna-v1.5-7B](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5) or [Vicuna-v1.5-13B](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5) as the base LLM and a two-layer MLP as the vision-language connector. The saved model checkpoints can be downloaded from the following Hugging Face Repository:

| Version | Size | Schedule | Base LLM | Vision Encoder | Projection layer | Checkpoints |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Table LLaVA | 7B | full_finetune-1_epoch | Vicuna-v1.5-7B | CLIP-ViT-L-336px | MLP-2x | [SpursgoZmy/table-llava-v1.5-7b](https://huggingface.co/SpursgoZmy/table-llava-v1.5-7b) |  
| Table LLaVA | 13B | full_finetune-1_epoch | Vicuna-v1.5-13B | CLIP-ViT-L-336px | MLP-2x | [SpursgoZmy/table-llava-v1.5-13b](https://huggingface.co/SpursgoZmy/table-llava-v1.5-13b) |

## 4. Training
### 4.1 Environment Setup
We use the code base of LLaVA v1.5 for model training and inference. Thus, Table LLaVA can be used as the normal LLaVA v1.5 model and the environment can be installed in a similar way. Note that our code base is downloaded in December 2023 and maybe not the latest. Please refer to the official [LLaVA v1.5 github](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/tree/main) for its latest update.

1. Clone this repository and navigate to Table-LLaVA folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpursGoZmy/Table-LLaVA.git
cd Table-LLaVA
```

2. Install Package
```Shell
conda create -n table_llava python=3.10 -y
conda activate table_llava
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
```

### 4.2 Training Data and Hyperparameters
Table LLaVA training consists of two stages: (1) Pre-training stage: the vision-language connector (a two-layer MLP) is trained to connect the frozen pretrained vision encoder (ViT) to the frozen LLM (Vicuna v1.5); (2) Instruction-tuning stage: the vision-language connector and the base LLM are trained to follow multimodal instructions.

The training data of each stage is shown below:

| Training Stage | Data Description | Data Size | Hugging Face Dataset |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Pre-training | 558K original LLaVA-1.5 pre-training data | 558K | [blip_laion_cc_sbu_558k.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain) |
|              | 150K table recognition data (MMTab-pre) | 150K | [MMTab-pre_pretrain_data_llava_format_150K.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpursgoZmy/MMTab) |
| Instruction Fine-tuning | 665K original LLaVA-1.5 fine-tuning data | 665K | [llava_v1_5_mix665k.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K) |
|              | 232K multimodal instruction tuning data of 14 tabular tasks (MMTab-instruct) | 232K | [MMTab-instruct_sft_data_llava_format_232K.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpursgoZmy/MMTab) |

The merged pre-training and instruction fine-tuning data in the LLaVA data format can be found in the [MMTab dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpursgoZmy/MMTab), 
i.e., ```enhanced_llava_pretrain_data_708K.json``` and ```enhanced_llava_sft_data_898K.json```, which can be directly used to train Table LLaVA.

Table LLaVA was trained on 8 A800 GPUs with 80GB memory. We use a similar set of hyperparameters as LLaVA v1.5 except that we increased the
max sequence length from 2048 to 2560 to accommodate longer text sequences. The hyperparameters used in pretraining and finetuning are provided below. 

| Stage | Trained Weights | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay | warmup ratio | Deepspeed Stage |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Pre-training | vision-language connector | 256 | 1e-3 | 1 | 2560 | 0 | 0.03 | ZeRO-2 |
| Instruction Fine-tuning | base LLM and vision-language connector | 128 | 2e-5 | 1 | 2048 | 0 | 0.03 | ZeRO-3 |

### 4.3 Pre-training

1. Download the original images for LLaVA v1.5 pretraining, i.e., ```images.zip``` from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain/tree/main). Put it under ```./LLaVA-Pretrain/images``` and unzip it.
2. Download ```MMTab-instruct_table_images_82K.zip``` and ```MMTab-pre_table_images_part_2_16K.zip``` from [MMTab dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpursgoZmy/MMTab/tree/main). Put them under ```./LLaVA-Pretrain/images``` and unzip them. Rename the ```IID_train_image``` dir to ```table_pretrain_part_1```.
3. Download ```enhanced_llava_pretrain_data_708K.json``` from [MMTab dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpursgoZmy/MMTab/tree/main) to ```./LLaVA-Pretrain```.
4. The resulting data should be organized as follows:

```
LLaVA-Pretrain
â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ table_pretrain_part_1
|   â”œâ”€â”€ table_pretrain_part_2
|   â”œâ”€â”€ 00453
|   â”œâ”€â”€ 00019
|   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
|   â””â”€â”€ 00095
â””â”€â”€ enhanced_llava_pretrain_data_708K.json
```

5. Training script with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2: [`pretrain_table_llava.sh`](https://github.com/SpursGoZmy/Table-LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/table_llava_scripts/pretrain_table_llava.sh). If you cannot automaticly download the base Vicuna v1.5 and ViT model through HuggingFace, you can download these models manually and set corresponding command-line parameters (```model_name_or_path``` and ```vision_tower```) to the local model paths. Once the pre-training is finished, the trained vision-language projector will be saved at the specified ```output_dir```.
